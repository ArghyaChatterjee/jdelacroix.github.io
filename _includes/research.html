                  <p>Despite the collective push towards greater autonomy in robots, most applications still require human intervention to guide autonomous robots in their tasks. Existing human-robot interfaces allow a human to intuitively interact with one or a few robots; however, as the number of robots involved in a task grows large, these interfaces become less effective or even unusable due to a lack of scalability for interacting with many robots at once.</p>

                  <p>Therefore, my Ph.D. research is focused on understanding large-scale human-robot (i.e., <em>human-swarm</em>) interactions and developing new techniques for collectively controlling large networks of robots with just a small number of simple inputs, rather than insisting that humans guide these robots invididually or in small groups.</p>
