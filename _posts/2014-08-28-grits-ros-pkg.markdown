######(Cover <a href="http://www.ros.org/news/2014/07/ros-indigo-igloo-released.html">image</a> by <a href="http://www.ros.org">Open Source Robotics Foundation</a> / <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">CC BY 3.0 US</a>)

This is the official [GRITS Lab](http://www.gritslab.gatech.edu) [ROS](http://ros.org) repository. It contains our in-house ROS packages for our hardware:

+ AR.Drone (Quadrotor)
+ Khepera III (Mobile Robot)
+ Optitrack (Motion Capture)
+ Vicon (Motion Capture)

as well as, any ROS packages for our lab's experiments and demos. For an up-to-date description of the repository's contents, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/gritslab/grits-ros-pkg/blob/master/README.md).

*Note*: These packages have been tailored to our lab's research and demos, but should be usable outside of our lab with little or no modifications. The `master` branch is reserved for our tested and stable codebase, while `development` or any other branches may be unstable derivatives of the stable codebase.

Yancy Diaz-Mercado and I are the current maintainers of this repository.
