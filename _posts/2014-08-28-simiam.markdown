Sim.I.am is an open-source mobile robot simulator for MATLAB and Simulink that facilitates the implementation and design of controllers and algorithms that can be deployed on both simulated and actual mobile robots.

</p>

The app is a demo of a multi-agent application, where one robot follows the other robot through a cluttered environment as shown in the screenshot below. A manual is included to help learn how to work with the simulator. It provides as set of programming exercises focused on how to implement the mobile robot navigation system (found in the app) from scratch.
